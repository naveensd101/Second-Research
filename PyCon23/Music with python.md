>[!info] My name is Sangarshanan and I am a Software Engineer from planet Earth. I love making stuff that helps and amuses me in equal measure and standing upside down while holding a banana. When I'm bored you can find me making absurdist memes, yet another spotify playlist or staring straight into the void
