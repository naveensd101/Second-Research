*Request For Comments* - RFC was just an unofficial doc made by Steve Crocker for ARPANET. It was a *hack* [[Side Projects]]. But now its *offical documentation* for the working of the Internet.

Many of the Docs are *experimental* stuff. But some of the RFCs were recognized by **IETF** - Internet Engineering Task Forse as *Internet Standards*

I read a bit of RFC 793 - [TCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793) - These RFC doccumentations are far superior to stuff that we get from other online tutorials

RFC doccumentation has a lot of fun *Engineering Humor* like [Avian Carier](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1149)
