- Arian 5 rocket issue 
- language to talk about correctness 
- input output and program 
- precondition postconditions program 

---

- from post condition 
- walk from end to start of code 
- check precondition is correct or wrong

---

- while loop how to prove 
- loop invariant 
- coming up with looop invarianr is not always easy 
- think of invariant while writing code - invariant finding is hard in general 

---

- we proved. "If program stops it will give correct answer. But not that program stops"
- Floyd hore logic - in talk

---

- stop condition of loop
- well ordering condition 
- can we always get these variant that reduces and we can exit the loop?
- 3x+1 problem - colada conjecture 
- loop variant vs strongest loop invariant 

- Lego model of turing machine 

---

What we can do for old code - i believe impossible ( halting problem i believe)
While writing new code - loop variant and invariant 
Program synthesis vs program verification 

---

Fix point theory - programs with loop
Exponential convergence
