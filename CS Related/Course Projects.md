This story was mentioned by [[VP sir]] when we were learning about *Increaseing reusability* in Software Engineering course yesterday (10:15 lecture).

In VPs PG days - he had 3 courses in one semester (Graphics design, Mobile Technologies, OOPs). For *all three* courses he had to submit a project at the end of the semester.
He and his one team mate spend a lot of night outs to make *three different* projects for each of the 3 subjects.
But one guy just came in without any team mate. Made a project which was *Visualization of Mobile tower algorithms with Graphics*. He could reuse one project for all the 3 courses.
