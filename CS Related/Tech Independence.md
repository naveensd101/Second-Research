Every one is talking about [[ChatGPT]]. I watched a tom scott video which tells how he talked to [[ChatGPT]] to write a script to manage his gmail tag system. He describes how he found out some bug in the code and mentioned to gpt and it easily corrected it. 

[[ChatGPT]] is owned by [[Open AI]] Which is in turn owned by [[Microsoft]]. They are trying to integrate gpt with bing so that we will get a bot to guide us through web surfing. 
This proposal makes Google in a very unstable position. This is the whole discussion of the below two videos.

I use a lot of google products
1. Gmail
2. Photos
3. Docs, Slides, Sheet
4. Drive

The bottom video talks about how a company got cancelled and had no place to host its contents. 

This can be a real situation if google thinks thinks to shut down its photos server.
