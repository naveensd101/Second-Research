## Books by author cateloge
I am having a tough time to get the list of books by an author in the order of publishing order. I can maybe use goodreads api to collect the list of books and show it in a website.

## Edit [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com)

I use monkeytype and [this](https://www.typingclub.com) site for most of my typing training. Monkeytype is good. Interface and customisability is very nice.
But the words that are given for typing is directly from a dictonary. And I feel that this will lead to increment in our actual typing speed.

monkeytype is a open source project and my idea is:
**Use a scraper to scrape wikipedia and other good sites for article and use them as text in mokeytype**

I just got another idea. Monkey type gives us a bunch of words to type on. I can use ToC logic to generate semantically correct sentences.
Inspired form [John fish youtube video](https://youtu.be/LzLe0U7FeDU).

### todo for this project:

- [ ] Learn [mokeytype codebase](https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype)
- [ ] Try implement the scraper.
