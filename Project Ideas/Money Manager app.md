**TLDR** - *Different tabs for different type of expense*

I have one account. But my expenses can be divided into categories.  
For example, gym expense is ₹1000 every month; Google one is ₹130, and prime is around ₹300. I want to keep different tabs on money.  
  
Fun cash should be separate. And money for trips should be separate. And at the end of the month, you can refill your tabs.
