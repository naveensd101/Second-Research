[[Idea]]

This might be the one [[Side Projects]] that will give me the edge
Steps
1. Ask edwin chettan about hardware
2. Learn server tech from college ssl servers.
3. Setup VPN so that I can access it from anywhere.

https://0x0.st/ - this website is a file hosting service kind of thing
```bash
> curl -F 'file=@nitc.png' https://0x0.st
https://0x0.st/HsW0.png
```
second line was the output and this thing hosts it. There is a code base for this. https://git.0x0.st/mia/0x0
once i setup my server I should give this a try

I asked Edwin about hardware. He told the best hardware will be old hardware that you have. And upgrade old stuff with second hand ram and nvmes. Let see we can buy some workstation out of nitc if possible.
