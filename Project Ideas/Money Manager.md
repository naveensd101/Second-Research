You will get a small influx of money most probably every month. Some percentage of the money should go into savings. There should be three parts 

1. Major savings for *masters* 
2. Emergency savings
	1. Hospital bill only 
	2. Emergency travell
3. Luxury saving
4. Daily use money

**Money division**
50% goes for masters on day 1

₹16,000 rent + ₹7000 (laundry lights etc) + Spotify ₹ 180 + Obsidian Sync ₹1000
Regular experiences total = ₹25,170

Rest all goes to fun money. 
Fun money should be the input to my Money management system 

Set a minimum money for living one day. Things to consider are: daily commute (bus minimum), food (4 times in a sufficiently good hotel) - I am guessing ₹500 for me now. 

M = fun money 
n = 31, interval for next installment 
Ideal daily use = M / n
m = minimum daily use money= ₹500
Daily limits:
- best case scenario = M / n
- Hard low limit = m

R = running fun money
d = days left for next installment 
**Day 1**
R = M
d = 31
e = expense that day
Min e = 0
Max e = value such that you can get m as the Max e of every other day

Next day R = R - e

## MVP
Influx money = M
Time for next paycheck= n (default 31)

Ideal per day expense = M / n

### Example
M = ₹ 3100
n = 31
Ideal per day expense = ₹ 100

| Days | Ideal per day expense |
| :-: | :-: |
| 31 | 100 |
| 1 | 100 |
| 2 | 100 |
| 3 | 100 |
| ... | ... |
| 29 | 100 |
| 30 | 100 |
| 31 | 100 |

But the above case is very ideal scenario. There will be some days that I might need more money and some days that I will use less. So I have to account for that.
